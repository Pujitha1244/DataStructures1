Strings are datatype like boolean, number etc
they are similar to Data Structures so that we can Manipulate them
Stored -> array of integers(Each Character)

Big O analysis

Read Character at given Index    :      T,s = O(1)
Traverse                         :      T = O(n) S=O(1)
Copy                             :      T,S = O(n)
Append                           :      T = O(n)
Concatinate                      :      T,S = O(n+m)



Strings are Immutable(after create cannot modify) in JS, Python, Java
