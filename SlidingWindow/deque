deque datastructure stands for doubly ended queue

Normal queue means FIFO
A deque ( "double-ended queue") is a data structure that allows you to add and remove elements from both ends efficiently.


Key Features of a Deque:
Double-Ended: Elements can be added or removed from both the front (head) and the back (tail) of the deque.

Dynamic Size: The size of the deque can grow or shrink as needed, similar to other dynamic data structures like lists or arrays.

Efficient Operations: Adding or removing elements from either end of the deque typically takes constant time, O(1)



Common Operations:
------------------
Add to Front: Insert an element at the front of the deque.
Add to Back: Insert an element at the back of the deque.
Remove from Front: Remove and return the element at the front of the deque.
Remove from Back: Remove and return the element at the back of the deque.
Peek Front: View the element at the front without removing it.
Peek Back: View the element at the back without removing it.
Is Empty: Check if the deque is empty.
Size: Get the number of elements in the deque.
